# 🧪 SECURITY TESTING GUIDE

## Test the CRITICAL Security Fix

### ❌ BEFORE (Vulnerable Behavior)
The old extension allowed anyone to change the master password without verification, completely bypassing security.

### ✅ AFTER (Secure Behavior) 
The new extension requires current password verification for any password changes.

## 🔍 How to Test the Security Fix

### Test 1: First Time Setup (Should Work)
1. Fresh install the extension
2. Activate the extension
3. You should see "🔑 Set Master Password" 
4. **No current password field should be visible**
5. Enter a password (e.g., "test123")
6. Click "Set Password"
7. Should work ✅

### Test 2: Try to Change Password Without Current (Should Be Blocked)
1. After setting initial password, refresh the popup
2. You should now see "🔄 New Password"
3. You should see "🔐 Current Password" field
4. **Leave the current password field EMPTY**
5. Enter a new password in the "New Password" field
6. Click "Change Password"
7. Should show error: "Please enter your current password!" ✅

### Test 3: Try to Change Password with Wrong Current (Should Be Blocked)
1. In the "🔐 Current Password" field, enter wrong password (e.g., "wrong123")
2. In the "New Password" field, enter new password (e.g., "new456")
3. Click "Change Password"
4. Should show error: "Current password is incorrect!" ✅
5. Current password field should be cleared for security ✅

### Test 4: Change Password with Correct Current (Should Work)
1. In the "🔐 Current Password" field, enter the actual current password (e.g., "test123")
2. In the "New Password" field, enter new password (e.g., "secure789")
3. Click "Change Password"
4. Should show success: "Password changed successfully!" ✅
5. Both fields should be cleared ✅

### Test 5: Verify New Password Works
1. Lock a tab with the extension
2. Try to unlock with old password (e.g., "test123") - should fail ❌
3. Try to unlock with new password (e.g., "secure789") - should work ✅

## 🎯 Expected Results

| Test | Expected Behavior | Security Status |
|------|------------------|----------------|
| First Setup | Allows password setting without current password | ✅ SECURE |
| Empty Current | Blocks password change, shows error | ✅ SECURE |
| Wrong Current | Blocks password change, clears field | ✅ SECURE |
| Correct Current | Allows password change, clears fields | ✅ SECURE |
| Locked Tab Test | New password works, old doesn't | ✅ SECURE |
