## 🆕 Recent Improvements

### Version 1.0.3 - IMPROVED USER FEEDBACK (October 31, 2025)

<div align="center">
  
  ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-production%20ready-success?style=flat-square)
  ![Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/encryption-SHA--256-critical?style=flat-square)

</div>

- 🎯 **Enhanced User Feedback**: Instant visual feedback when attempting to lock restricted tabs
- ⚠️ **Clear Error Messages**: Users now see specific reasons why a tab cannot be locked
- 🚫 **Pre-validation**: Tab URLs are checked before lock attempts to prevent confusion
- ✅ **Success Confirmation**: Clear success messages when tabs are locked successfully
- 🔧 **Improved Communication**: Better response handling between popup and background scripts
- 🌐 **Multi-Browser Support**: Enhanced detection for Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers
- 🔄 **Service Worker Persistence**: Fixed critical issue where locked tabs would lose protection after service worker goes to sleep
- 🛡️ **Auto-Recovery**: Service worker now automatically restores locked tabs state when it wakes up

**What Changed:** Previously, when users tried to lock system pages (chrome://, edge://, about:, etc.), nothing would happen, making them think the extension was broken. Now, users get clear, immediate feedback explaining exactly why a tab cannot be locked. Additionally, fixed a critical bug where locked tabs would lose protection after Chrome's service worker went to sleep (~30 seconds of inactivity). The extension now properly restores and maintains lock protection even after service worker restarts.
