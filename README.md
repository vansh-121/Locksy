## � Trust & Verification

### 📦 Verify This Extension Matches The Source Code

**Concerned about what you're installing?** You should be! Here's how to verify Locksy is trustworthy:

#### 🚀 Quick Verification (5 minutes)

**[→ Follow the 5-Minute Verification Guide](docs/VERIFY.md)**

1. **Network Test**: Open DevTools → Use extension → Confirm ZERO network requests
2. **Offline Test**: Disconnect internet → Extension still works perfectly
3. **Source Check**: Compare installed files with GitHub repository

**No network requests = No data can leave your device. It's that simple!**

#### ✅ Three Ways to Deep Verify

1. **Download Pre-Built Releases** (Easiest)
   - Visit [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vansh-121/Locksy/releases)
   - Download `.zip` files with SHA-256 checksums
   - Compare with your installed extension

2. **Build From Source** (Most Secure)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vansh-121/Locksy.git
   cd Locksy
   npm install
   npm run build
   # Compare dist/ files with store version
   ```
   **[→ Full Build Instructions](docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md)**

3. **Inspect Your Installation**
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or `edge://extensions/`)
   - Enable Developer Mode
   - Find Locksy → Details → View Source
   - Compare files with this repository

#### 🔐 Why You Should Verify

The store listings warn: **"Read and change all your data on all websites"**

**Sounds scary!** Here's the truth:
- ✅ We need `<all_urls>` to inject the lock screen on ANY site you choose to lock
- ✅ We **never** read page content, passwords, or personal data
- ✅ The code is **100% open source** - check for yourself!
- ✅ Works **completely offline** - no network requests
- ✅ Detailed explanation in [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md)

**Don't take our word for it - verify the code yourself!**

- 🚫 **Extension Pages**: Chrome Web Store, extension management pages
- 🚫 **New Tab Pages**: Empty tabs or browser new tab pages
- 🚫 **System Pages**: Browser internal pages and configurations

**Why?** Browsers restrict extensions from modifying these pages for security. When you try to lock these tabs, you'll now see a clear message explaining why it cannot be locked.

✅ **Lockable Tabs**: All regular websites (http://, https://) including news sites, social media, banking, email, etc.

### 🛡️ Security Features

### ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

Locksy includes **pre-configured keyboard shortcuts** that work out-of-the-box. **Ready to use** - No setup required!

#### 🎯 Available Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Command | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `Alt+Shift+9` | **Lock Current Tab** | Instantly locks the active tab |
| `Alt+Shift+0` | **Open Domain Manager** | Opens Domain Lock Manager window |
| `Alt+Shift+8` | **Lock All Tabs** | Locks all tabs in current window |

#### ✨ Features
- 🔔 Smart notifications for every action
- 🛡️ Automatic safety checks (password, activation status)
- ⚡ Instant feedback with detailed messages
- 🎯 Bulk operations (lock all tabs at once)

#### ⚙️ Customize Shortcuts (Optional)

1. **Navigate to Shortcuts Page:**

   - Edge: `edge://extensions/shortcuts`
   - Brave: `brave://extensions/shortcuts`

2. **Find Locksy** in the list

3. **Click the pencil icon** next to any command and press your desired key combination

4. **Best Practices:**
   - ✅ Use `Alt+Shift+[Key]` combinations for least conflicts
   - ✅ Try alternative keys if conflicts occur (e.g., `Alt+Shift+Q`, `Alt+Shift+Z`)
   - ❌ Avoid browser shortcuts (`Ctrl+T`, `Ctrl+W`, `Ctrl+D`, etc.)
   - ❌ Don't use keys already taken by other extensions

#### 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **"Not set" or grayed out?** → Another extension is using that combo
- **Not working?** → Check if browser shortcuts override it
- **Still conflicts?** → Try alternative combinations like `Alt+Shift+Q`, `Ctrl+Shift+Period`, or `Alt+Shift+[0-9]`

See [Keyboard Shortcuts Documentation](docs/KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS.md) for detailed usage guide.

### 🕶️ Incognito Mode
1. **Enable Permission**: Go to `chrome://extensions/` → Locksy → Details → "Allow in Incognito"
