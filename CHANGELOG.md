## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-31

### üéØ Enhanced User Feedback

#### Added
- **Instant Visual Feedback**: Users now receive immediate notifications when attempting to lock restricted tabs
- **Pre-validation Check**: Tab URLs are validated before lock attempts to prevent confusion
- **Clear Error Messages**: Specific explanations for why a tab cannot be locked
- **Success Confirmations**: Visual confirmation when tabs are locked successfully
- **Multi-Browser Detection**: Enhanced detection for Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Service Worker Startup Handler**: Added `chrome.runtime.onStartup` listener to restore locked tabs when service worker wakes up
- **Auto-Recovery System**: Implemented lazy loading of locked tabs state in all event listeners

#### Improved
- **popup.js**: Enhanced lock button handler with pre-validation and response handling
  - Added URL validation before sending lock message
  - Checks for `chrome://`, `edge://`, `about:`, extension pages, and empty tabs
  - Displays user-friendly error messages for restricted tabs
  - Shows success messages when tabs lock successfully

- **background.js**: Improved message handling and response system
  - Added `sendResponse` callback to `lockTab` function
  - Enhanced error handling with descriptive messages
  - Better communication between background script and popup
  - Added support for async response handling
  - Implemented `restoreLockedTabs()` function to reload state from storage
  - Added `chrome.runtime.onStartup` listener for service worker restart handling
  - Added safety checks in all event listeners to restore state if service worker just woke up
  - Prevents loss of locked tabs protection due to service worker lifecycle

#### Fixed
- **Silent Failure Issue**: Previously, clicking "Lock This Tab" on system pages did nothing, making users think the extension was broken. Now, users see clear feedback explaining why the tab cannot be locked.
- **Service Worker Sleep Bug**: Critical fix for locked tabs losing protection after Chrome's service worker goes to sleep (~30 seconds of inactivity). The extension now properly restores locked tabs from storage when the service worker wakes up, ensuring continuous protection even after periods of inactivity.

#### Technical Details
- **Restricted Tab Types**: System pages (`chrome://`, `edge://`, `about:`), extension pages, Chrome Web Store, and empty tabs cannot be locked due to browser security restrictions
- **User Feedback**: All lock attempts now provide immediate visual feedback via the notification system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages guide users when tabs cannot be locked
- **Service Worker Lifecycle**: Chrome MV3 service workers sleep after ~30 seconds of inactivity. The extension now handles this by persisting locked tabs to `chrome.storage.local` and restoring them on service worker wake-up
- **State Persistence**: `lockedTabs` Set is now automatically restored from storage when service worker starts or when any event listener fires after sleep
- **Console Logging**: Added debug logs to track service worker restarts and locked tabs restoration
